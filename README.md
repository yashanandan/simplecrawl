# SimpleCrawl
Simple webpage crawler using python

## Usage
```
pip install -r requrements.txt
```
```
python Crawl.py -s http://python.org -m 100
```

- -s denotes the page from which crawling should begin
- -m is the maximum number of pages to crawl

## Learnings from this
- shifted to python coding style like usage of underscores and lower case names from java's traditional camelCase usage.
- tried with docopt for the first time
